# Math Object Methods Task

### Task Overview
This task involves working with JavaScript's `Math` object methods. You'll create functions that perform various mathematical operations such as rounding, finding the largest/smallest number, calculating the square root, and more. Your goal is to use the methods provided by the `Math` object and implement them in different ways.

### Task Instructions

1. **Round a number using `Math.round()`**
   - Implement a function that takes a number as input and rounds it to the nearest integer using `Math.round()`.
   - **Expected output**: Rounded number

2. **Round a number down using `Math.floor()`**
   - Implement a function that takes a number as input and rounds it down to the nearest integer using `Math.floor()`.
   - **Expected output**: Rounded down number

3. **Round a number up using `Math.ceil()`**
   - Implement a function that takes a number as input and rounds it up to the nearest integer using `Math.ceil()`.
   - **Expected output**: Rounded up number

4. **Find the largest number using `Math.max()`**
   - Implement a function that takes a list of numbers as input and finds the largest number using `Math.max()`.
   - **Expected output**: Largest number

5. **Find the smallest number using `Math.min()`**
   - Implement a function that takes a list of numbers as input and finds the smallest number using `Math.min()`.
   - **Expected output**: Smallest number

6. **Calculate the square root of a number using `Math.sqrt()`**
   - Implement a function that takes a number as input and calculates its square root using `Math.sqrt()`.
   - **Expected output**: Square root of the number

7. **Generate a random number using `Math.random()`**
   - Implement a function that generates a random number between `0` (inclusive) and `1` (exclusive) using `Math.random()`.
   - **Expected output**: Random number between 0 and 1

8. **Find the power of a number using `Math.pow()`**
   - Implement a function that takes a base and an exponent as input and calculates the result using `Math.pow()`.
   - **Expected output**: Result of base raised to the exponent

9. **Find the absolute value of a number using `Math.abs()`**
   - Implement a function that takes a number as input and calculates its absolute value using `Math.abs()`.
   - **Expected output**: Absolute value of the number

10. **Calculate the sine of an angle using `Math.sin()`**
    - Implement a function that takes an angle (in radians) as input and calculates its sine using `Math.sin()`.
    - **Expected output**: Sine of the angle

### Submission Guidelines
- Implement the functions as per the instructions.
- Test each function by inputting different values and verifying the output.
- Submit the final HTML and JS code after testing the functions.

Good luck, and happy coding!
