## Array Methods

This section contains tasks to help you understand and practice important array methods in JavaScript. Complete the following tasks step by step, implementing and testing each method as described.

---

## Task 1: Array Iteration and Transformation

1. **`map()`**: Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array with each number doubled.
2. **`forEach()`**: Create an array of names and log each name to the console.
3. **`filter()`**: Given an array of numbers, create a new array containing only the numbers greater than 5.
4. **`reduce()`**: Write a function to calculate the sum of all numbers in an array using `reduce()`.
5. **`find()`**: Given an array of objects with `id` and `name` properties, find the first object where `name` equals `"John"`.
6. **`findIndex()`**: Given an array of numbers, find the index of the first number greater than 10.
7. **`some()`**: Write a function that checks if any number in an array is negative.
8. **`every()`**: Write a function to check if all numbers in an array are even.

## Task 2: Adding and Removing Elements

1. **`push()`**: Add a new element to the end of an array.
2. **`pop()`**: Remove the last element of an array and log the removed value.
3. **`unshift()`**: Add a new element to the beginning of an array.
4. **`shift()`**: Remove the first element of an array and log the removed value.
5. **`splice()`**:
   - Remove the second and third elements from an array.
   - Insert two new elements at the second position in an array.
6. **`slice()`**: Create a new array containing only the first three elements of an existing array.

## Task 3: Searching and Sorting

1. **`indexOf()`**: Find the index of the number `5` in an array.
2. **`lastIndexOf()`**: Find the last occurrence of the number `3` in an array.
3. **`includes()`**: Check if the number `10` exists in an array.
4. **`sort()`**:
   - Sort an array of numbers in ascending order.
   - Sort an array of strings alphabetically.
5. **`reverse()`**: Reverse an array of numbers.

## Task 4: Joining and Splitting

1. **`join()`**: Convert an array of words into a sentence, separated by spaces.
2. **`concat()`**: Combine two arrays of numbers into a single array.

---

## Task 5: Flattening and Mapping

1. **`flat()`**: Flatten a nested array of numbers (up to 2 levels deep).
2. **`flatMap()`**: Given an array of strings, create a new array where each string is split into its individual characters.

---

## Task 6: Utility Methods

1. **`Array.isArray()`**: Write a function that checks if a given variable is an array.
2. **`from()`**: Convert a string into an array of characters.
3. **`of()`**: Create an array with three numbers using `Array.of()`.

### Notes:
- Make sure to write clean and reusable code.
- Add comments to explain the logic behind each task.
- Test each method thoroughly with various inputs.
